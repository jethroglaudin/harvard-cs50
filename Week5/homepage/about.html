        <h5><strong>Why Trust DCS for Commercial Cleaning & Building Maintenance?</strong></h5>

        <br>

        <h3><strong>Dependable, Thorough Commercial Cleaning Services. No Long-Term Contracts. Quality Score Rating
                System (QSRS).</strong></h3>

        <br>

        <h4><strong>Here’s why we are different from other commercial cleaning providers:</strong></h4>

        <h6><strong>1. Quality Control</strong></h6>

        <p>
            Quality control is our number one focus and is how we can deliver consistent results for our clients. We use
            a proprietary rating system called the Quality Score Rating System (QSRS) which was developed and
            implemented by DBS to constantly monitor the performance of each cleaning crew using real and measurable
            factors.</p>

            <h6 style="color: rgba(187, 63, 10, 0.975);"><strong>How QSRS Works?</strong></h6>
            <p>
                    Every cleaning crew is assigned a Quality Score Rating (from 1 – 5), which is assessed and updated monthly, based on the quality of service they provide to their current customers. Their QSR is based on real and measurable factors, including:

                    Client feedback and surveys
                    Internal feedback (from DBS’ Customer Service Department)
                    Account Retention Rates & Statistics

            </p>
